  Based on the result of a submission transaction returned from the Ethereum node, figures out what to do (namely:
  crash on or ignore an error response that is expected).

  It caters for the differences of those responses between Ethereum node RPC implementations.

  In general terms, those are the responses handled:
    - **known transaction** - this is common and expected to occur, since we are tracking submissions ourselves and
      liberally resubmitting same transactions; this is ignored
    - **low replacement price** - due to the gas price selection mechanism, there are cases where transaction will get
      resubmitted with a lower gas price; this is ignored
    - **account locked** - Ethereum node reports the authority account is locked; this causes a crash
    - **nonce too low** - there is an inherent race condition - when we're resubmitting a block, we do it with the same
      nonce, meanwhile it might happen that Ethereum mines this submission in this very instant; this is ignored if we
      indeed have just mined that submission, causes a crash otherwise
